/// Rybizki, et al. (2022): A classifier for spurious astrometric solutions in Gaia EDR3 (2022, MNRAS, accepted). Data replicated from the gedr3spur.main table at the GAVO Data Center TAP service https://dc.g-vo.org/tap and TAP metadata as of December 2021.
/// Original table description.
/// The Gaia mission is delivering exquisite astrometric data for 1.47 billion sources, which are revolutionizing many fields in astronomy. For a small fraction of these sources the astrometric solutions are poor, and the reported values and uncertainties may not apply. Before any analysis, it is important to recognize and excise these spurious results, commonly done by means of quality flags in the Gaia catalog. Here we devise and apply a path to separating “good” from “bad” astrometric solutions that is an order-of-magnitude cleaner than any single flag: 99.3% pure and 97.3% complete, as validated on our test data. We devise an extensive sample of manifestly bad astrometric solutions: sources whose inferred parallax is negative at ≥ 4.5 sigma; and a corresponding sample of presumably good solutions falling into a number of categories, including sources in HEALPix pixels on the sky that do not contain extremely negative parallaxes, and sources that fall on the main sequence in a color–absolute magnitude diagram. We then train a neural network that uses 17 pertinent Gaia catalog entries and information about nearby sources to discriminate these two samples, captured in a single “astrometric fidelity” parameter. An extensive and diverse set of verification tests shows that our approach to assessing astrometric fidelity works very cleanly, including in the regime where no negative parallaxes are involved. The main limitations of our approach are in the very low-SNR, crowded regime. Our astrometric fidelities for all of eDR3 can be queried via the Virtual Observatory. In the spirit of open science, we make our code and training/validation data public, so that our results can be easily reproduced.
