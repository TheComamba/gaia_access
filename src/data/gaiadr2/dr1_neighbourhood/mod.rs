/// Users wishing to look up the DR2 record for an astrophysical source
/// identified in DR1 must NOT simply extract the record from DR2 having the
/// same source identifier.
///
/// As described in the detailed description of attribute designation in
/// GaiaSource it is not guaranteed that the same astronomical source will
/// always have the same source identifier in different Data Releases. Hence
/// the only safe way to compare source records between different Data
/// Releases in general is to check the records of proximal source(s) in the
/// same small part of the sky. This table provides the means to do this via
/// a precomputed crossmatch of such sources, taking into account the proper
/// motions available at DR2.
///
/// Within the neighbourhood of a given DR2 source there may be none, one or
/// (rarely) several possible counterparts in DR1 indicated by rows in this
/// table. This occasional source confusion was introduced during the DR1
/// processing which used an earlier version of the software for matching of
/// transit observations to unique astrophysical sources. The subsequent
/// merging, splitting and deletion of identifiers introduced at DR1 during
/// the DR2 processing means there is no guaranteed one–to–one
/// correspondence in source identifiers between the releases.
///
/// For more details of the procedure used to create this crossmatch, see
/// Section [chap:xmdr1] in the online documentation.
