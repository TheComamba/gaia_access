/// <p>RAVE DR5 Neighbourhood table includes all good neighbours for each matched RAVE DR5 object.
/// A good neighbour for a given RAVE DR5 source is a nearby Gaia object whose
/// position is compatible (within position errors) with the RAVE DR5 target. <br/>
/// The cross-match algorithm is not symmetric and searches RAVE DR5 sources counterparts in Gaia.
/// The cross-match algorithm is positional and exploits the full 5
/// parameters covariance matrix of Gaia astrometric solution when available and the
/// external catalogue positions and position errors. In addition it takes into account the
/// Gaia environment using the local density.<br/>
/// <br/>
/// Please note that the cross-match algorithm is a trade-off between multiple requirements, in
/// particular between completeness and correctness. It is thus not limited to a simple cone search.<br/>
