/// <p>RAVE DR5 BestNeighbour table lists each matched external catalogue object with its best
/// neighbour in Gaia.
/// The cross-match algorithm is not symmetric and searches RAVE DR5 sources counterparts in Gaia.<br/>
/// The best neighbour is chosen among good neighbours as the one with the highest value of
/// the figure of merit, which evaluates the ratio between two opposite models/hypotheses:
/// the counterpart candidate is a match or it is found by chance.
/// Good neighbours are nearby objects in Gaia whose position is
/// compatible within position errors with the external catalogue target.<br/>
/// The cross-match algorithm is positional and exploits the full 5
/// parameters covariance matrix of Gaia astrometric solution when available and the
/// external catalogue positions and position errors. In addition it takes into account the
/// Gaia environment using the local density.<br/>
/// <br/>
/// Please note that the cross-match algorithm is a trade-off between multiple requirements, in
/// particular between completeness and correctness. It is thus not limited to a simple cone search.<br/>
